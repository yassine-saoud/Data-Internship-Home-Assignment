Knowledgeable in PCB test standards, FPGA testing and high-speed board test design. Methodologies of calibration and understanding of measurements uncertainty, six sigma and ICT/DFT/FCT. The candidate will work closely with the hardware design teams throughout the product life cycle by defining and specifying test requirements. You will be supporting pre-testing of the Hardware developed by the design teams and supporting the team through product execution, ultimately leading the manufacturing test team to leverage your ATE test platform. The ideal candidate must be responsive, flexible and able to succeed within an open collaborative peer environment across multiple projects simultaneously. Interface with the R&D designers and other Hardware Engineers to define the most efficient and accurate measurement for testing the boards functionality. Design the test fixtures. Ability to remotely manage computers using SSH or VNC protocol using Git version control. Work closely with validation test engineers to insure that the test fixtures would satisfy module automated testing. Drive system verification of solutions through ATE/FCT. Support the HW team with sub system bring-up and test fixtures. Responsibility for Test definition and calibration of the ATE. Collaborate with HW Design Engineers to develop and execute hardware verification test plans. Board level functional testing Design, build and program test systems used in HW testing as well as generate automated reports tracking for test results. Analyze test results and test data to determine if design meets functional and performance specifications. Extensive experience in testing of Digital and Analog/Mixed signal circuits Experience using RF measurement instruments, high-speed oscilloscopes, signal generators, arbitrary waveform generators. Ability to read and interpret PCB schematics and perform basic digital and analog circuit analysis Experience designing and analyzing test procedures to minimize measurement error Knowledge of industrial controls systems and their communications interfaces and protocols such as Ethernet/IP Proficiency with measurement automation tools and scripting languages such as, Python, Labview, Labwindows and Matlab. Experience with electronic hardware design tools such as Cadence or Mentor Graphics Familiarity and experience working with, Gigabit Ethernet, FPD link, CAN, SPI, I2C, LIN, and RS232. Minimum Qualifications: Bachelor\u2019s degree in Electrical Engineering or similar technical discipline MSEE Preferred Minimum 5 years of experience as a Test Engineer supporting product introduction. Desired Skills: Ability to install and configure a Linux distribution on desktop (or embedded) systems. Familiarity with the pre-built high-performance computing (HPC) software stack used in AMD (Xilinx) devices. Comfortable installing pre-built Linux packages, with the occasional build from source. Write humble high-level test scripts in Python using pre-compiled software to support that aspirations low-level real-time DSP designers.
