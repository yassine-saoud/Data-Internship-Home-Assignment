        "description": "SentiLink is building the future of identity verification in the United States.\u00a0The existing ways to determine if somebody is who they claim to be are too clunky, ineffective, and expensive, but we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better. We\u2019ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly.\u00a0Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services.\u00a0We\u2019ve raised over $15M from investors including a16z, Nyca partners, and Max Levchin, and current and former CEOs/CROs/CCOs of major US financial institutions.\u00a0We\u2019ve earned coverage and awards from CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and others.\u00a0And we\u2019ve even been a part of history--we were the first company to go live with the\u00a0eCBSV\u00a0and testified before the\u00a0United States House of Representatives.

You will work with teams across the company to research new types of fraud, develop new products, and provide analysis to drive sales and marketing.
