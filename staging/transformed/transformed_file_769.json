Here at CollegeVine, we're working to close the guidance gap by providing free, personalized guidance to all students. We've helped thousands of students get into college since 2013, and in 2019 pivoted to an all-digital guidance offering to expand our impact. Transitioning from one-on-one guidance to a 100% software offering is a big responsibility, but we've been able to meet it thanks to our unique culture. You'll be joining a distributed, talented team that's deeply invested in the problems we're trying to solve. We live all around the world, working from our homes, coffee shops, and even a boat!

You'll be responsible for maintaining your own roadmap, with input from our product teams. But the roadmap is ultimately yours. Your first week You'll be given a crash course in how college admissions works. You'll meet the team and start working on one of the projects in our backlog. Finally, you'll start learning how our website works. Your first month You'll continue working through the project backlog. We also expect you'll be soaking up admissions knowledge, which means you'll start suggesting some project ideas of your own.

Flexible workday with a 4-hour core centered on EST - plan the rest of your workday as you wish, just give us the majority of your most creative hours. Goal-based environment (as opposed to grind-based or decree-based environment; work smarter, not harder; intelligently, not mindlessly). We collaborate on setting goals, but you set your own process for accomplishing those goals. You will be entrusted with a lot of responsibility and you might even experience fulfillment and self-actualization as a result. Join an engineering culture that celebrates mindfulness and takes the quality of your attention seriously. Remember: We\u2019re a startup. You\u2019re an early employee. We face challenges. We have to ship (a lot). Your ideas matter. You will make a difference. We are committed to a diverse and vibrant workforce.
