With nearly 30 million active users, we\u2019re one of the fastest-growing companies in education technology, but we have our sights set on something bigger: giving every student the opportunity to succeed. Remind runs one of the largest free services in education, one of the fastest growing school/district SaaS businesses (the\u00a0Remind Plan), and a revolutionary new direct to consumer business (Remind Coaching). The common thread through each of our product lines is the belief that success in education is driven by relationships, and the Remind communication platform is where the next generation of education relationships live.

You have expert level SQL skills, but more importantly you know how to design performant and understandable datasets for the whole Remind team. You are a curious and communicative person\u2014you seek to understand before building and therefore more often build the right thing first. You are fast and rigorous analytically, with a degree in engineering, math, statistics, analytics, or relevant alternative education (adult learning, on the job experience etc). What you'll do Delight data consumers (internal and external) by ensuring they have the data they need to inform decisions, where and when they need it. Define and own organization-level data architecture for a trusted, governed, dimensionally-modeled repository of data that enables the Remind team to quickly and reliably answer their questions.
