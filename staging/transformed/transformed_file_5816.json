        "description": "About Cheetah Restaurants and small businesses account for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual purchasing, yet most of it happens offline. From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a series of truck deliveries. With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\u2019s services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. Partnering with the largest suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley user experience to an industry that hasn\u2019t evolved in decades. In the process, we\u2019re helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply chains to familiar faces, and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and new opportunities. At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb.
