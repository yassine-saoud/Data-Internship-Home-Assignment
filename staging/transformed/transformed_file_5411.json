We are reimagining how things move in cities. Our personable sidewalk delivery robot, Serve, is a small, low-speed self-driving vehicle that\u2019s designed to take deliveries away from congested streets to save energy and reduce emissions, while making deliveries faster and cheaper. Having completed thousands of commercial deliveries for Postmates (now Uber) in Los Angeles and San Francisco, we recently spun out with backing from top tier investors to grow faster and target the entire sidewalk delivery market. Our commercial agreement with Uber provides us unlimited access to delivery jobs\u2014and thus revenue. We are proud to be an equal employment opportunity and affirmative action employer.
