        "description": "If you want to achieve more in your mission of health care, you have to be really smart about the business of health care. Challenge yourself, your peers and our industry by shaping what health care looks like and doing your life's best work.(sm) We\u2019re looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to design new data infrastructures and using that infrastructure to deploy machine learning solutions. In this role, you will directly contribute to our mission by working 70% engineering and 30% machine learning/data science building AI/ML systems, models, and infrastructure that increases the quality, performance, accuracy, and effectiveness of our products. Additional responsibility is to support machine learning efforts, including tools design, pipeline maintenance and upgrades, as well identifying current and future bottlenecks of the system As a Machine Learning Engineer on the team you will build data and tools that enable analytics to inform product and engineering teams at scale. You\u2019ll enjoy the flexibility to telecommute* from anywhere within the U.S. as you take on some tough challenges. Primary Responsibilities You have engineered metrics and statistical information out of massive and complex datasets (e.g. Spark MLlib, Druid, Solr, Kafka) You have built robust feature extraction and ML training pipelines and have a keen eye for where to automate (e.g. Oozie, Airflow) You have done prototype-to-production development of ML models. You care about improving training performance by researching into latest algorithms. You also value scaling inferences by utilizing CPU/GPU resources in parallelized fashion and have a strong foundation in data structures and optimization algorithms You are knowledgeable in classic machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN etc). Good understanding of bias/variance trade-off, regularization, dimension reduction You have some experience in modern deep learning techniques via packages such as Keras/Tensorflow Software engineering fundamentals: version control systems (i.e. Git, Github) and workflows, and ability to write production-ready code Participating in the engineering life-cycle, including designing high-quality ML infrastructure and data pipelines, writing production code, conducting code reviews, and working alongside our infrastructure and reliability teams You care about data generating processes, not just modeling them, but understanding the actual human and computational behavior from which data emerges You are fluent in at least one programming language (e.g. Python, Scala) and are comfortable developing code within a team environment (e.g. Github, testing, code reviews) You are self-motivated and curious. You continue to learn on the job You have demonstrated creative and critical thinking with an innate drive to improve how things work You have a high tolerance for ambiguity. You find a way through. You anticipate. You connect and synthesize You can influence decisions with excellent verbal and written communication skills Design and create environments for data scientists to build models and manipulate data Work within client systems to extract data and place it within an analytical environment Learn and understand customer technology environments and systems Define the deployment approach and infrastructure for models and be responsible for ensuring that businesses can use the models we develop Reveal the true value of data by working with data scientists to manipulate and transform data into appropriate formats in order to deploy actionable machine learning models Partner with data scientists to ensure solution deployability at scale, in harmony with existing business systems and pipelines, and such that the solution can be maintained throughout its life cycle Create operational testing strategies, validate and test the model in QA, and ensure the quality of the delivered product You\u2019ll be rewarded and recognized for your performance in an environment that will challenge you and give you clear direction on what it takes to succeed in your role as well as provide development for other roles you may be interested in.
