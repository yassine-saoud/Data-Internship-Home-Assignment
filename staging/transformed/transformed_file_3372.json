        "description": "Software Engineer I \u2013 Brain Science The mission of the Allen Institute is to unlock the complexities of bioscience and advance our knowledge to improve human health. Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science. The mission of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to accelerate the understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. Using a big science approach, we generate useful public resources, drive technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory. The Allen Institute for Brain Science seeks a Software Engineer to develop applications and open scientific databases that serve neuroscience and brain imaging research communities around the world. Your colleagues will contribute high volume scientific experiments to your databases; scientific, computer vision, and other numerical software to process those data; and web applications that enable users to navigate, search, and visualize the data products. The successful candidate will join a team of developers responsible for the databases, services, and APIs that support computational neuroscientists, the Institute's laboratory information management system (LIMS), and web application products. You will interact with neuroscientists and a wide variety of engineers, collaborating in a large team working on new discoveries about the brain. Our team uses popular modern software tools and cloud services. Responsibilities of this position include designing and developing software, writing unit tests, reviewing your peers\u2019 code, documenting APIs, and demonstrating your work.
