We aim to build infrastructure that keeps pace with the world, so developers can focus on what matters most: building the best products. Join us on our mission to Make Data Easy. About The Role CockroachCloud provides CockroachDB as a service to anyone who needs to scale fast, survive anything, and thrive everywhere. We are standardizing on Kubernetes as the compute runtime platform for both CockroachCloud and self-hosted deployments of CockroachDB. The Kubernetes Operator is the unifying fabric that will unlock multi-tenant, multi-region and auto-scaling capabilities for all CockroachDB deployments. You\u2019ll be helping build out the CockroachDB operator, developed fully in open source, and ensuring that it is the best way to deploy, manage and scale CockroachDB. Internally the operator is used to deploy and manage thousands of CockroachCloud clusters, from small starter side projects to multi-region production clusters. Working closely with our SRE team and other Engineers, you will be part of a collaborative culture striving to make data easy at global scale by combining distributed databases with a beautiful user experience.

The Team Isaac Wong - VP of Engineering Isaac is responsible for the health of the engineering organization at Cockroach Labs. He partners closely with teams to ensure we have a balanced culture that promotes quality and innovation in pursuit of our goals. Before joining Cockroach Labs Isaac was in life sciences for 16 years with Medidata Solutions where he had a front row seat on the exciting ride from a 30 person startup to more than 2000 people worldwide. But the lure of distributed, resilient, and consistent SQL databases, along with the amazing technology and culture at Cockroach Labs proved too much. When not working he likes to draw, play the piano and search NYC for cannolis with his wife and kids. Yandu Oppacher - Director of Engineering Yandu works across multiple parts of CockroachCloud to ensure that our infrastructure and teams are robust and scalable. Yandu joined Cockroach Labs after nearly 8 years at Shopify where he started on the data platform team and helped it grow from 4 DB nodes to several hundred Hadoop nodes running over petabytes of data in Google Cloud. In his last 2 years at Shopify, he led the Production Engineering teams responsible for all of the compute runtime resources that power Shopify\u2019s mission critical services. Joining CockroachCloud and Cockroach Labs allows him to get back to his first love, Databases, while applying his Production Engineering skills to help build our DBaaS platform. Outside of Cockroach Labs Yandu will be found reading or, more likely, chasing after his 3 young kids and exploring the outdoors with them.
