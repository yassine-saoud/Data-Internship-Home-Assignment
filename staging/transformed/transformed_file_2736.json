        "description": "We\u2019re building fully-electric farm machines for sustainable and regenerative agriculture. We have received a National Science Foundation SBIR grant to do research on computer vision for understanding plant geometry. This is a challenging problem in farm fields where many plants can overlap and occlude one another. We\u2019re looking for a remote software developer to help with building and running the software involved in this research. The grant period is 9 months, but if the project goes well there is a good chance that the work will continue after that. Requirements: experience with C++ experience with Python experience with image processing and/or computer vision algorithms experience with PyTorch and/or TensorFlow based in US Optional: experience with developing and running machine learning models on AWS experience with OpenCV To apply: please send a resume along with a link to some C++ and/or Python code that you have written. Compensation: $117k/year (for 9 months) plus health insurance",
