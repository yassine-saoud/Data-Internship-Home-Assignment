        "description": "About Cheetah Restaurants and small businesses account for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual purchasing, yet most of it happens offline. From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a series of truck deliveries. With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\u2019s services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers.
