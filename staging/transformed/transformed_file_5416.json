        "description": "TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. The Trust & Safety team at TikTok helps ensure that our global community is safe and empowered to create and enjoy content across all of our applications. As a global community that thrives on creativity and expression, it's important that users feel safe and comfortable in this community. TikTok's US Safety team is dedicated to making TikTok safe for our users, viewers and content creators globally. Our policies and tools are developed to promote a positive and safe environment for our community. We are building a threat research team to conduct quantitative or mixed-methods research driven by subject matter expertise in multiple areas, including: Violent Extremism (Radicalization, Recruitment, and Mobilization), Coordinated and Inauthentic Behavior, Advanced Persistent Manipulation, Mis/Disinformation, Minor Predation, Bullying and Harassment, Scams, and/or Transnational Criminal Organizations. Using subject-matter expertise and scientifically rigorous analytical methodologies, a threat researcher will have the opportunity to run research projects to test different threat-related hypotheses and answer research questions that help improve the capabilities of threat analysts, increase the accuracy of current threat detection models, improve current platform policies, and improve the accuracy/efficiency of threat mitigation processes. What will I be doing? - Conduct high-impact data-driven research projects that answer pressing questions related to threat detection, analysis, and mitigation across multiple high priority issue areas. - Create and run experiments aimed at testing current product/process assumptions and identify key gaps that must be addressed in the near and distant future. - Lead collaboration with external partnerships in threat intelligence and academia on on-platform and cross-platform research projects. - Lead large-scale and high-impact research projects aimed at company-wide product/process evaluation and optimization. - Use current understanding of industry practices and processes to develop high-impact research questions and hypotheses. - Use both quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis to best answer high-priority research questions around threats. - Use both internal and external data to find the best and most comprehensive answer to threat research questions. This may include using already developed external data pipelines or developing new collection methods according to research needs. - Work cross-functionally with product managers, program managers, security, operations, policy, public relations, government relations, and communications teams to answer research questions around current threat response processes such as detection and mitigation. - Sit on a team of experts as a research consultant that not only respond to known bad actors, but proactively search and identify potential threats in order to build scalable protections to keep them out. - Actively use data-driven research results to strengthen threat detection and investigation SOPs. - Train new researchers and threat analysts/investigators on best practices and threat knowledge. What you will bring with me? - Doctorate or Master's degree in Psychology, Communication Studies, Information Sciences, Sociology, International Relations, Criminal Justice, Public Policy, Political Science, or other relevant field. - An understanding of online deceptive and manipulative behavior. Knowledge of the signals of specific threat actors, their cross-platform tactics, and how they evolve or change over time. - Knowledge of social media processes and products, as well as current gaps that can be exploited by threat actors. - Understanding of current industry data analytical capabilities and shortcomings. - Expertise in big data analysis, experimental design, survey-design, content analysis, and/or statistical analysis (multivariate analysis of variance, correlation/regression, etc.). - SQL, Python or similar scripting languages. Even better if: - Published research regarding social media use by violent extremists, malign actors, child exploitation actors, or other criminal actors. - Strong preference for functionality in a second language besides English. - Critical thinking skills to be able to apply theories or analytical techniques when developing high-impact research projects that would benefit internal teams. - Excellent writing skills. TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We believe individuals shouldn't be disadvantaged because of their background or identity, but instead should be considered based on their strengths and experience. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.",
