        "description": "Company Description Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect entrepreneurs with buyers around the world. As an Etsy employee, you\u2019ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact. Job Description Etsy is hiring a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to join our Ads Ranking team. This opportunity is excellent for someone who is interested in applying machine learning to tackle user-facing problems. The primary goal of the team is to improve the relevance of Etsy\u2019s on-site ads, and to price the ads fairly and efficiently. Much of this work relies on improving the accuracy of machine learning models that power our click-through-rate prediction and automatic bidding systems. We also develop new product experiences driven by machine learning systems. Our team works on both the development of these models, as well as the tooling we use to train, evaluate, deploy, introspect and monitor them. About The Team Our team is responsible for ranking and pricing ads on behalf of our sellers on Etsy\u2019s website and mobile apps. This is an opportunity for you to play a major role in connecting our buyers with Etsy\u2019s 90+ million listings through our ML-fueled ad platform. Here\u2019s a taste of the problems we\u2019re solving: How does the team ensure that the right ads are put in front of the right buyers? How can we help our sellers set bids to achieve the highest rate of return? How do we rank millions of ads in a matter of milliseconds, so that we\u2019re giving our buyers the best experience while maximizing revenue? How do we maintain a pipeline that scales for our 40+ million buyers and sellers? How can we detect bad actors in our system to protect sellers? Your work will span our stack, touching Python, TensorFlow, Scala, Spark and Google managed services such as BigQuery, Dataflow and AI Platform. We are proud to have an engineering culture that supports career growth and learning. You can learn more one of our recent projects on our Engineering blog: https://codeascraft.com/2021/03/23/how-we-built-a-context-specific-bidding-system-for-etsy-ads/ We are language-agnostic in our approach to interviewing.
