        "description": "Who We Are At Aurora, we\u2019re on a mission to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly. It all starts with the Aurora Driver, a platform created from industry-leading hardware and software and designed to adapt across a variety of vehicle types and industries. We\u2019re led by a team of self-driving luminaries, and we\u2019ve forged strategic partnerships with leading transportation companies\u2014including ride-hailing network Uber, truck-manufacturers PACCAR and Volvo Trucks, and the world\u2019s largest automaker Toyota\u2014setting us up to deliver the Aurora Driver in both trucks and passenger vehicles. We are funded by Amazon, Uber, T Rowe Price, and some of Silicon Valley\u2019s best venture capital firms, including Sequoia, Greylock, and Index Ventures. Aurora is in the best position to lead the self-driving space with a team of unparalleled depth and expertise, the technology to deliver, and the partnerships to build a transformative business for the long-term. Aurora hires talented people with diverse backgrounds who are ready to help build a transportation ecosystem that will make our roads safer, get crucial goods where they need to go, and make mobility more efficient and accessible for all. We\u2019re searching for a Data Science Architect to lay the foundation in making data-informed decisions that impact the Autonomous Vehicle behaviors, verification and validation of Aurora's self-driving technology and business growth. While interviewing, you will be expected to intelligently reason about various applications of data science in the verification and validation of autonomous driving which include heuristics that define safe driving behavior, data adequacy requirements to address sample size issues, and data quality issues. Your role will interface with Product, Autonomy Development, Systems and Safety Engineering teams and will drive mission-critical decisions in a multi-trillion dollar industry. In this role, you will Define safety risk framework/architecture to quantify system and subsystem risk Define heuristic models and data requirements to establish statistical arguments for good driving behaviors Identify key metrics for safety and performance of autonomous driving in selected Operational Design Domains (ODDs), based on first principles, as well as an analysis of manual and autonomous driving miles Establish human driving performance and safety baselines in selected ODDs Define data-driven targets for autonomous driving performance and safety in selected ODDs. Be able to argue for why those targets are valid and reason about the effect on traffic safety if those targets are achieved Guide the design of Simulated and real-world driving experiments to efficiently understand the gaps between achieved system performance/safety and desired targets Assist with methodologies and planning for AV verification and validation at system and subsystem level Support the development of market entry plans that align market opportunity with technical capability Support and educate other technical teams on their data science needs Identify, utilize, or create as appropriate the needed technical machinery for large scale data analysis and visualization. In particular, to analyze historical and current data and use it to predict future system performance Discover and analyze relevant information from multiple large data sets to further Aurora's mission of delivering Autonomous Vehicle technology Safely, Quickly and Broadly Work with Motion Planning, Perception, Safety and Simulation engineers to ensure their respective teams have the information they need to make timely, informed decisions. Surface succinct, actionable data widely in regularly updated dashboards Required Qualifications MS or PhD in Statistics, or a related field. Experience architecting data and software systems to facilitate reliable statistical analysis at scale Practical knowledge of common data analysis, inference, and statistical modeling tools, including Python and/or R Self-starter who will see opportunities to apply capabilities that add value throughout the organization Superb analytical and problem solving skills, and an ability to deeply understand the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of what we are working on Strong interpersonal and communication skills Excellent planning and organizational abilities Ability to technical leadership and mentoring Enthusiasm for applying data science to the toughest challenges in autonomous driving 6+ years of experience in a Data Science/Statistical Analysis role is preferred Working at Aurora At Aurora, we bring together people with extraordinary talent and experience united by the strength of our values. We operate with integrity, set outrageous goals, and continue to build a culture where we win together\u2014all without any jerks. Benefits We also offer a competitive benefits package that supports the whole you, including We have offices in Pittsburgh, Mountain View, San Francisco, Bozeman, Dallas and Seattle. Competitive salary, bonus and RSU package Premium choices for Medical, vision, and dental 401k benefits Life and disability benefits 18 weeks paid leave for new parents and caregivers Flexible vacation and company paid holidays Fertility benefits through Carrot Working from home support Professional growth and mentorship opportunities through the Aurora Academy Wellness Platforms (Spring Health, Headspace, Aaptiv, Quit Genius) We believe that self-driving technology has broad benefits \u2013 including an increase in safety and access to transportation \u2013 and to achieve those benefits, we want and need a workforce with diverse experiences, insights, and perspectives; said another way, a workforce that reflects the communities and people our technology will benefit.

About Aurora Founded in 2017, Aurora was started by industry luminaries, and now we\u2019re a team with a multitude of perspectives and experiences. Chris Urmson helped lead Carnegie Mellon\u2019s efforts in Darpa\u2019s Grand Challenges, then was a founding member of Google\u2019s self-driving team. Sterling Anderson worked on the tech at MIT before leading Tesla\u2019s Model X and Autopilot programs. Drew Bagnell, also a Carnegie Mellon alum, is a machine learning expert who helped build Uber\u2019s autonomy effort. Regarded as the most experienced leadership team in the industry, these three bring decades of expertise, passion and focus to realizing our mission.",
