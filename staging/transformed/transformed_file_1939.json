        "description": "We are a global leader in management consulting. With offices in 50+ cities across 30 countries, We combine deep industry knowledge with specialized expertise in strategy, finance, operations, technology, risk management, and organizational transformation. Our 5,000+ professionals help clients optimize their business, improve their IT, operations and risk profile, and accelerate their organizational performance to seize the most attractive opportunities. Our professionals see what others don't, challenge conventional thinking, and consistently deliver innovative, customized solutions.\u00a0 As a result, we have a tangible impact on clients\u2019 top and bottom lines.\u00a0 Our clients are the CEOs and executive teams of the top Global 1000 companies. ____ PRACTICE OVERVIEW We partner with clients to deliver breakthrough outcomes for their toughest digital challenges. We blend the power of digital with deep industry expertise to tackle disruption and create impact. By building strong capabilities and culture, we accelerate and embed digital transformation. Our people co-create and grow customer-focused solutions that win. We modernize technology and harness value from data and analytics. We build resilience so our clients are ready for tomorrow\u2019s risks and optimize operations for the future. Above all, we work collaboratively with our clients\u2019 leaders, employees, stakeholders, and customers to jointly define, design, and achieve lasting results. ____ THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES No two projects are the same. You\u2019ll be working with varied and diverse teams to deliver unique and unprecedented products across industries. The Principal Data Scientist is primarily responsible for advancing our broad capabilities to use and deploy cutting edge data scientific tools and methods in our projects, platforms and products. S/he both anchors our current best practices by designing and building reusable data science assets, and simultaneously works to keep us on the bleeding edge by understanding the very latest and most sophisticated methods and tools for grappling with extremely large scale and complex problems. As a Data Scientist, you will work alongside our partners in the Digital and other practice groups, engage directly with clients to understand their business challenges, and craft appropriate solutions to be delivered by specialists and consultants. Your responsibilities will include, for example: Exploring data and crafting models to answer core business problems that may not have a common blueprint Guiding data science consultants on the best path to solving problems in a specific technical domain in which you are the expert Explaining, refining, and crafting model insights and architecture to bring stakeholders through the journey of model building Inventing and pioneer R&D efforts to bring new approaches and state of the art methods to our clients Codifying best practice approaches to specific analytical problems in the form of accessible, reusable patterns, templates, and code bases Leading efforts to standardize and industrialize solutions such that they can be robustly deployed into production and/or scaled up far beyond the laptop-scale ____ YOUR EXPERIENCE & QUALIFICATIONS You are a well-rounded technologist who brings a wealth of real-world experience and a: Technical background in computer science, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics or other quantitative and computational science A compelling track record of designing and deploying large scale technical solutions, which deliver tangible, ongoing value: Direct experience having built and deployed complex production systems that implement modern, data scientific methods at scale and do so robustly Comfort in environments where large projects are time-boxed and therefore consequential design decisions may need to be made and acted upon rapidly Fluency with cluster computing environments and their associated technologies, and a deep understanding of how to balance computational considerations with theoretical properties of potential solutions Ability to context-switch, to provide support to dispersed teams which may need an \u201cexpert hacker\u201d to unblock an especially challenging technical obstacle Demonstrated fluency in modern programming languages for data science, covering a wide gamut from data storage and engineering frameworks through to machine learning libraries Expert knowledge of at least one and probably several core machine learning frameworks, including but not limited to: TensorFlow, Keras/Theano, Torch, Caffe, MxNet; Scikit-Learn, etc. Deep understanding of the architecture, performance characteristics and limitations of modern storage and computational frameworks, with experience implementing solutions that leverage: HDFS/Hive; Spark/MLlib; Kafka, etc. A history of compelling side projects or contributions to the Open Source community is valued but not required Solid theoretical grounding in the mathematical core of the major ideas in data science Expert level understanding of a class of modelling or analytical techniques, often supported by Masters- or Doctoral-level research in the subject Deep fluency in the mathematical \u2018primitives\u2019 and generalizations of data science \u2013 e.g., expertise in Linear Algebra, and Vector Calculus Experience presenting at high-impact data science conferences and solid linkages to the data science community (e.g., via meet-ups, continuing relationships with academics, etc.) is highly valued Interest/background in Financial Services, and capital markets in particular; Health and Life Sciences; Consumer, Retail, Energy, or Transportation ____ YOUR ATTRIBUTES Our team comprises all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds. We don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re loud or quiet, funny or serious, introverted or extroverted. We do, however, ask that you have: An undergraduate or advanced degree from a top academic program A genuine passion for technology and solving problems A pragmatic approach to solutioning and delivery Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written A clear commitment to creating impactful solutions that solve our clients\u2019 problems The ability to work fluidly and respectfully with our incredibly talented team Willingness to travel (when its safe to do so again)",
