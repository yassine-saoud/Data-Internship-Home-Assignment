        "description": "We\u2019re looking for a backend software engineer to help us build out a next-generation freight technology platform. As an early engineer at Baton, you\u2019d be given the opportunity to make an impact on a growing team and to own numerous mission critical backend services. Our team isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to get the job done - whether that\u2019s hacking something together to quickly test a prototype, hanging out at a warehouse all day to make sure we understand exactly what needs to be built, or designing innovative solutions using technology to drive new business opportunities. We're looking for people who move fast and are driven to make complex and inefficient systems work better. Why should you join us? At an early stage startup, things move fast and you\u2019ll have far more responsibility and opportunity for growth than at a larger company. You will learn. A lot. You\u2019ll iterate through many careers-worth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. However, you won\u2019t have to go it alone -- at Baton, you\u2019ll have mentorship from accomplished senior engineers and work alongside an impressive team from the top universities and tech companies around. Baton (https://www.baton.io/) is a well-funded startup backed by 8VC, Maersk, SV Angel, Prologis, and some of the most successful technology and freight entrepreneurs in the world. See coverage here by Joe Lonsdale (https://rb.gy/segzm6), and here by FreightWaves (https://rb.gy/zpeo0i). We\u2019re trying to reimagine how goods are moved. There is an enormous amount of waste in the backbone of the American economy (https://rb.gy/bn9qvg) and we have an opportunity to eliminate it. Whether it\u2019s finding ways to eliminate detention, reduce empty driving miles (1 in 5 trucks on the road is empty!), improve working conditions for 3.5 million drivers, or accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift that will shape the future of the trucking industry. You will have the opportunity to help architect this paradigm shift. If this resonates with you, we\u2019d love to get to know you! Please apply. Your role: Software Engineer - Backend Generalist Take ownership of numerous backend services -- from ML/ Optimization data pipelines to data model all the way up to the API layer to, you\u2019ll be the go-to person when adding new features. Invent and tinker. Imagine completely new ideas, experiment, and build transformative solutions for the freight industry. Collaborate with us. We\u2019re a close-knit team with product, engineering, and operations all working together to build elegant products that improve drivers\u2019 lives while reducing the massive inefficiencies in trucking. Grow with the team. We raised our Series A and are primed to grow our engineering team to tackle the challenges that come with scaling our business. You\u2019ll get to experience the learnings (and the growing pains) that come with working at a startup trying to disrupt and transform an industry. Where you live: San Francisco Bay Area or willingness to relocate Basic Qualifications: 2+ years experience in software development Backend development experience with Python or other modern programming languages Comprehensive knowledge of modern web architectures Willingness to learn new technologies and to own the backend for major product features Nice to have: Experience with Tensorflow, Google ORTools or related ML/Optimization SDKs Interest in the freight and logistics space",
