Job Category Products and Technology Job Details What we do \u2026 In Tableau we help people understand data. We do so by enabling people to transform data into something visual and understandable, helping them make important decisions based on those insights. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you. With large deployments of Tableau, containing millions of visualizations, we need to provide people with tools to find the data that is important to them. No matter how good our platform is at showing meaningful and beautiful visualizations, they can\u2019t have an impact if they cannot be found. The search team\u2019s mission is to create a unified content discovery and search experience for all of Tableau\u2019s products. We do so by combining advanced search algorithms with machine learning to provide consistent and meaningful results appropriate to the users context and workflow to help them find relevant data and insights available within their organization to answer their business questions. As an engineer on the search team, you will develop and deploy UI components and services at scale building on top of Elasticsearch powering search across various Tableau products. We follow a service oriented design, and use technologies such as React, JavaScript, Java, Python, Spring framework, docker, New Relic, Splunk, PagerDuty, Elasticsearch , Kubernetes, Octopus, and AWS. Currently we are looking for a full stack developer to join our fast growing search team. Some of the things you\u2019ll be doing include \u2026 Participate in all phases of the software development life cycle. This includes defining and executing test plans for functionality, integration, regression, performance and UI. Participate in the evolution of the system architecture at scale to decouple our code bases into microservices and micro-frontends to enable incremental releases of search improvements. Contribute to the design, development, test and operational excellence of Java services and libraries supporting search functionality. This includes participating in on-call support for our services on a rotational basis. Build robust and scalable services leveraging cloud based infrastructure. Participate in design and code reviews, break down and estimate work, select and incorporate appropriate tools and frameworks for the job. Uphold a high standard of engineering excellence in source code, testing and operations. You will proactively anticipate risks and take steps to mitigate them. Who You Are \u2026 Experienced: You are well-versed in a variety of technologies and languages, and are in particular experienced in React and Java with at least 4+ years relevant experience. You have experience building scalable services in Java with common frameworks and libraries popular in Java shops. You\u2019ve worked with a variety of database technologies with large datasets and understand how to optimize for maximum performance and scale. You should understand microservice design patterns well and how to create loosely coupled SaaS systems to find the right balance. You have experience with agile development methodologies and testing. You are interested in solving the search problem but prior experience in search is not a must. Relentlessly High Standards: Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality codes. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. Coding Rockstar: You understand what it takes to write software that is used by millions of people. You love writing things that \"just work\" - things that are reliable, scalable, and secure. You think far enough ahead to avoid tech debt, but know how to avoid over-engineering. You are agile and can prototype, learn, adapt, and pivot as needed. DevOps Mindset: You are familiar with DevOps practices. You treat operational issues as they are software problems. As you write your code you are already thinking about how to operate them efficiently in production. Team Player: You enjoy collaborating with, learning from, and teaching others (including across disciplines) so we all become better. You enjoy fostering a continuous learning environment and champion technical excellence within the team. You are a Recruiter! Tableau hires company builders and, in this role, you will be asked to be on the constant lookout for the best talent to bring onboard to help us continue to build one of the best companies in the world!
