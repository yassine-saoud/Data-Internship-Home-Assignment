We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn\u2019t real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.",
