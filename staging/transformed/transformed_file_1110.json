        "description": "Are you a seasoned leader hoping to apply your experience to the next exciting frontier in technology sales? Now is the time to join the most exciting company in Cloud and Digital Workspace. The Cloud is here, and everything has changed. In the age of mobile and cloud, consumer devices and application experiences are shaping how businesses drive digital transformation. This affects the ways companies engage their customers, employees, and partners, and no longer can we reliably depend on singular, heavily instrumented, on-premise applications. Instead, computing today requires a broad, multi-channel strategy that spans on-premise systems and multiple cloud service providers. Doing it right, while not forsaking traditional on-prem needs, requires longevity and experience; the very kind that VMware has. VMware solves these cloud generation problems with a comprehensive portfolio of integrated solutions. The platform is comprised of a wide range of products and services; covering many of the capabilities required by exceptional IT operators and developers. VMware earns its seat at the table because of this broad set of capabilities, and IT executives can\u2019t help but pay attention to the innovations that VMware brings.

Responsibilities Work tightly with assigned Region Director(s) to identify \u201cline-of-sight\u201d to the annual plan. The region plan should incorporate all dimensions of the business, including how to overachieve the target, customer whitespace to pursue, how partners and ecosystem are leveraged, marketing, networking through industry associations, etc. Stay up to date on current events and be a student of the industry and culture. Assist in delivering compelling executive briefings. Articulate the ways VMware solutions provide increased business value and improved technical capability when compared to our competitors. Train and mentor sales peers. Be responsible for the performance and development of direct reports.

Recommend 3rd party integrations as needed. Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or equivalent. 8+ years of successful sales engineering experience in IT domains. Examples include systems virtualization, SDDC, cloud, network security, mobile management, DevOps, SAN, etc. Certifications such as TOGAF, ITIL, Agile CSM or CSPO strongly preferred but not required.
