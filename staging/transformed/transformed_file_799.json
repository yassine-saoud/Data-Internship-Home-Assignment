        "description": "Job Summary: In this role, you will use Python and other software tools to help solve a variety of data, hardware, and software problems. You work with the Engineering team and cross-functionally to help solve customer needs and improve internal systems. You will help enhance and ensure the effective operation of our software as it relates to data and its interactions with our hardware applications. What you will do (responsibilities): Apkudo is agile, and so our days and duties can vary. In this role, some of the things you will do include the following: Use Python and a variety of other software tools such as PostgreSQL, Ansible, QEmu, AWS services (as well as others) to both solve problems and enhance data, hardware, and software issues. Examples may include designing or enhance ETL pipelines, refining pipeline connections with AWS RDS and/or helping enhance communications and data extraction with our hardware (shipping and receiving stations or our robotic testing machines). Respond and resolve operational and data issues, troubleshoot and initiate corrective actions as necessary, and use your experience to improve system stability using the right software tool for the job.\u00a0 Please note that our general stack includes Python, PostgreSQL, AWS, React, JavaScript (ES6), and Node.js. Design new and improve existing internal data and other software features to enhance our offerings and products. Help our customers and internal teams better utilize our tools to make valuable strategic data-driven decisions. Work on multiple dissimilar projects at the same time: both intellectual and productive agility are required. What you will bring (experience and qualifications): At Apkudo, we enjoy delivering for each other and our customers, and we know there are many paths to performing well.\u00a0 That having been said, we will expect you to come up to speed fast and deliver great work without too much guidance. We think it would be hard to do that in this job without the experience below: A degree in Computer Science or a related field with a Masters in Computer Science a plus. Please note that directly relevant experience may substitute for, and/or augment, relevant degrees. 5-9 years of progressive software experience working with hardware and software in a production environment. 3+ years of experience in Python design, implementation, and test including data-related work.\u00a0 We are looking for someone to help us develop, refine, and enhance Python code used with Data AND in other areas. Experience working with software and hardware components for user-facing hardware and/or software applications. Experience with configuration management, virtualization, and Linux environments. Exposure to robotics and warehouse automation is a plus. Strong communication and problem-solving skills with attention to detail and the ability to work effectively both independently and with other remote team members. Excellent verbal, written, and organizational skills. If you think differently and know that you can do the job well, apply and show us! What we expect from everyone: What does it take to be successful at Apkudo? We expect ourselves and each other to: Put people first (by helping others be at their best--and making sure we are, too) Communicate clearly (by speaking candidly, regularly, and respectfully to everyone) Own our work and the outcomes (by taking personal ownership to deliver on the commitments we make to our colleagues and our customers) Trust and be trustworthy (by acting with integrity and providing excellent work for each other and our clients) Value everyone\u2019s voice (because it\u2019s all about the best ideas--not bureaucracy). What you can expect from us: Solving hard problems is challenging work, and we have designed Apkudo to support you in doing what no one else has done. Some of the ways we do that: 4 weeks of time off every year. Most of it doesn\u2019t roll over because we know we won\u2019t use it otherwise - and we know using it makes us better at our work and to each other. Flexible working hours and schedules (some positions - like this one - will do some on- call weekend work on occasion, but we expect you to take time off during the week to make up for it!) Casual dress and a casual environment with easy access to your peers, managers, and leaders A company-paid Google Pixel phone or a monthly credit to apply for your tech needs (including upgrading your bandwidth) 12 paid holidays, including Juneteenth and the day after Thanksgiving A monthly wellness stipend that you can use for things like a meditation app, standing desk, gym equipment, etc. 401(k) matching up to 4% Up to $5,250/year for certification, continuing education, and tuition reimbursements Insurance coverage we\u2019re proud of for you, your family, and your spouse or domestic partner.\u00a0 We pay 100% of the cost of coverage for you for vision (through VSP), dental (through Guardian Dental), and some medical plans (through United Health Care, the largest health insurance company in the U.S.). HSAs, FSAs (health care, dependent care), and commuter benefits to reduce what you have to pay for these parts of your life An open and communicative culture, innovation, and interesting problems to solve The fine print This role is remote though you may also be asked to travel on occasion.\u00a0 Currently, our primary locations are Dallas, Baltimore, and Nashville.\u00a0 Travel for this role is anticipated to be 0-5%. The physical requirements include prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer (though you can use the tech benefit to create whatever desk you\u2019ll work best at). We are an agile organization, and so the duties and description of this role (like every other at Apkudo) may change at any time as we adapt. This position is exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). About Apkudo Apkudo is the developer of Hive, the platform for the management of the connected device supply chain. Through an applied combination of artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, and sophisticated automation, the Hive Platform manages the world of devices for all supply chain stakeholders by injecting intelligence and transparency throughout the entire device lifecycle: from design, development, testing, and certification to forward and reverse logistics. We test and certify, test and triage, and provide stakeholders (OEMs, Carries, Insurers, and 3PL) with the data to help them balance device quality, velocity, and precision across all supply chain processes to optimize device experiences and device value.
