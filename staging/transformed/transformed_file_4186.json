This role presents the unique opportunity to work throughout the entire technology vertical of the company. Your first year at Red Leader will involve helping design and bring up novel electronics, architecting safety-critical real-time applications, and deploying high performance algorithms on state-of-the art RF-integrated SoCs. Autonomy is the goal for both our sensor and our engineers - you will be expected to make systems-level decisions as we roll out our first product. Our ideal candidate is passionate about both working close to the hardware and pushing silicon and software to its limits. They will have deep experience in bare-metal / systems-level software, PCB bring-up, and programming in both high and low-level languages, with a strong software engineering or electrical engineering background. They will be fluent in C, C++, and Python, and they value good coding practices including versioning, reviews, and testing. They see joining our team as an early engineer as a leap that will accelerate growth in their career by entrusting them with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility, and visibility. To excel in this role, you will have worked on high-performance compute platforms in the past (for example, FPGAs + SoCs, GPUs) and have had experience debugging and testing hardware. You should be comfortable writing performant programs, pursuing testability and maintainability in software development, and enjoy working with teammates that have hardware expertise and high-level software expertise. \ud83d\udcdd Responsibilities Design and develop high-throughput, highly-optimized software and firmware Architect software systems and interfaces with high-reliability and maintainability Develop and build applications within real-time operating systems Support hardware engineers with hardware bring-up, debugging, and testing Develop drivers across high-level and low-level software interfaces Support applications software engineers with data ingestion and processing Propose future software development efforts Maintain comprehensive architecture & design documentation \ud83c\udfc5 Qualifications Minimum 2 years of industry experience Strong foundations in computer architecture and code performance Strong hands-on lab skills for characterization, testing, and debug Deep experience with (and intricate knowledge of) C, C++, and Python Experience with (Real-Time) Operating Systems Experience with Parallel Computing, High Speed Compute Experience with Serial Interfaces, Ethernet, Networking Familiarity with safety-critical / real-time applications (Avionics / Medical / Automotive) a plus Familiarity with FPGAs and SoC platforms (preferably Xilinx) a plus Familiarity with GPU Programming / CDUA a plus Familiarity with Verilog / VHDL / System Verilog a plus Familiarity with formal methods and verification a plus \ud83c\udf34 Benefits Health Insurance (Medical, Dental, Vision) 401(k) w/ Employer Matching Employee-Friendly Stock Grants Generous (but intentionally not unlimited!)
