        "description": "The Applied AI Research team works on innovative solutions to solve practical real-world problems with direct impact on users of the OpenAI API . Powerful language models like GPT-3 excel at learning behavior patterns from the pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. Thus the quality and scale of the datasets will play a crucial role in any applications built on top of such models. We seek a Machine Learning Engineer to help design and build the pipelines to collect and manage high-quality data for various projects within Applied AI. Candidates for the Machine Learning Engineer, Data Quality role should have good engineering skills, industry experience in Machine Learning / Data Science, knowledge of processing a large amount of data in various formats and passion for building AI products. In This Role You Will Design data pipelines, including finding appropriate data sources, scraping, filtering, post-processing, de-duplicating, and versioning. The system should be robust and scalable for production use. Design and implement frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of our models and data. For example, building an automated fine-tuning pipeline to compare the performances of different datasets or models on the same task. Work closely with others who might be data contributors or consumers or both to incorporate their data usage needs on a variety of tasks and domains. Work with our human labeling service to refine the procedure and guidelines to collect high-quality human annotation data. Conduct open-ended research to improve the quality of collected data, including but not limited to, semi-supervised learning, human-in-the-loop machine learning and fine-tuning with human feedback. You Might Enjoy This Role If You Have 3+ years industry experience as a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Scientist, dealing with large amounts of data on a daily basis. Are goal-oriented, passionate about building cutting-edge AI products and solving real-world problems from our API developers. Have a strong belief in the criticality of high-quality data and are highly motivated to work with the associated challenges. Enjoy taking ownership while working with others to understand their needs. Care about code quality and enjoy building tools that can be used by many others.
