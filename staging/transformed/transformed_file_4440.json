There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions: What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not? What's your admin/coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now? What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals? How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend?
