        "description": "CAN WE MAKE RECYCLING, BETTER? There is a\u00a0tremendous\u00a0amount of value in recycled materials: paper, plastic, metal ... But that value is heavily \"eroded\" in the cost of the high cost of manual labor needed to properly sort materials at recycling centers. Our heavily mission-driven client is revolutionizing the recycling industry with AI-driven robots. Their products are now working across the country, and they are deeply expanding their reach: Right now, they are a Series B Company with almost 75M in total funding. Their strong mission to make recycling better is just ONE of the many reasons they keep climbing up and up-and-up-and-up our list of the BEST Companies in Colorado. We are helping them hire across the board ... they are hiring for Developer roles,ML/AI roles, EE roles, RoS roles etc. ... That said, we are specifically focused on helping them hire Senior Robot Software Engineers :\u00a0They generally hire \"polyglots\" but right now their deepest needs are centered around Software / Hardware Integration , ROS and C++ with TypeScript & JavaScript experience a nice bonus :) If you're a Senior/Lead/Staff/Principal Robotics Developer (Front End, Back-End, or Full-Stack )and you want to learn more about this company, OR if you just want to have an open-ended chat about your careers goals, perhaps one of the 37 other Software Engineering roles we are working on could be a good fit\u00a0for you :) Salary: They are hiring at all levels, but so this is a wide range, but the general target for \"Senior Candidates is 130K - 150K, with room to go up to 170K for the right candidates. Benefits: Health, Dental, Vision, 401K, Strong PTO Location: Their office is in Louisville, but right now and for the foreseeable future (maybe forever), most Software Development teams are working 100% remotely. That said, they do prefer local candidates to keep the door open to meeting a few times a month. Looking forward to meeting you! Cheers, -Will p.s.
