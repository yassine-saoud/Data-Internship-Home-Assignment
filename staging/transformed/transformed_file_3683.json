Job Category Products and Technology Job Details What we do \u2026 Tableau is as much a philosophy as an amazing suite of tools. We enable people to transform data into something visual and understandable, enabling people to make important decisions based on those insights. Our primary mission is to help all people see and understand the meaning behind the world\u2019s data, covering a wealth of domains from social justice to health care to environmental issues. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you. Tableau Public plays an important role in connecting people with relevant, high-quality data stories. This role has been more important than ever as the world struggles to understand the impact of COVID 19. Tableau has taken a position as a source of trusted data and analysis for COVID19, and Tableau Public has been the backbone of this effort. There has been a surge in Tableau adoption, as local and state governments, as well as public health institutions, are communicating important COVID19 data and statistics with their constituents using Tableau Public visualizations. Besides helping people see and understand their data, we also have some really fun architectural and scaling challenges. Tableau Public is the largest Tableau deployment in the world and has the largest data visualization repository in a single place. In addition to supporting the busiest Tableau server in production, our team has been a front-runner at Tableau in exploring new technologies. Tableau Public was one of the first teams to transition to AWS, Kuberbetes, Docker, and React, and we continuously strive to leverage emerging products to help us improve our customer's experiences on the platform.

Experience in engineering practices around continuous deployment would be an asset. Finally, you should love learning new things, being a mentor, and leading by example as you push for engineering excellence. Some of the things you\u2019ll be doing include \u2026 Development of the Tableau Public specific backend services, which leverage Tableau Server for its core functionality. Helping the team to continue building robust and scalable services leveraging cloud based infrastructure. Experimenting with newer technologies and champion them as needed. Contribute to the design, development, test and operational excellence of Java services and libraries supporting Tableau Public. This includes participating in on-call support for our services on a rotational basis. Work closely with product management and other internal partner teams to understand requirements and strategically incorporate them into the platform. Participate in design and code reviews, breaking down and estimating work, and selecting and incorporating appropriate tools and frameworks for the job. Uphold a high standard of engineering excellence in source code, testing and operations. You will proactively anticipate risks and take steps to mitigate them. Who You Are\u2026 Experienced .

You also have experience with agile development methodology, and you understand what it takes to write software that is used by millions of people.

Technical. You are well versed with Spring, Hibernate or any other ORM, and have worked with a variety of relational and NoSQL databases. Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality even under schedule pressure. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. You know how to find the slow queries, caching problems, and how to successfully scale a SaaS service. You understand traditional architectures, but also understand and have worked with Microservices architecture enough to know the pros and cons and where the right balance is.
