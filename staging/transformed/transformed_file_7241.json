Courses on Maven have community at their core, focus on active learning, and are available anywhere in the world. Our team has raised $25 million from incredible investors including Andreessen Horowitz, First Round, Naval, and Arlan Hamilton, and we've launched sold-out courses with instructors like Li Jin, Anthony Pompliano, Lenny Rachitsky, and Sahil Lavingia. We're the leading player in a massive and growing market, but are still early enough for you to make a big impact. Join us! The Role You will be one of the first 10 engineers at the company, owning features end-to-end, becoming an expert on parts of our product, and building the platform that powers the best cohort-based-courses on the market. You Will: Be one of the first 10 engineers on our team Own features end-to-end: e.g. payments, emails, live sessions, community, analytics, internal tools Collaborate with engineers, designers, and others across the team Work full-stack with Typescript, React, Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Postgres, and AWS (Aurora, ECS, Elasticache), Github Actions, & Vercel. Be an influential part of building a world-class online learning platform You Have: Shipped features in production apps with real users Experience with full-stack development: Javascript/Typescript frontend frameworks (preferably React - open to other technologies such as Angular, Vue, Redux) API development on the backend (preferably Python - open to other technologies such as Ruby, Go, PHP, Java) Judgement around when to do something quickly, and when to build for the long term Product instincts, and a keen eye for why users want what they want A desire to strengthen those around you If you don't meet these criteria but are still excited about Maven, reach out anyway - we'd love to hear from you. Our Culture: We're growing quickly but we're still a startup, and you'll have the opportunity to shape how we work. So far we've looked for teammates who: Are hungry to learn, and can give and receive ego-free feedback Take pride in doing great work, and in helping others do the same Value clear thinking and open communication Don't just solve problems - they seek them out, take ownership of the solution, and see it through from idea to execution Are willing to throw away ideas, and are optimistic enough to keep hunting for new ones Think 80/20 and focus on getting the right stuff done, not the most stuff possible Come Build With Us We're a fully remote company with employees in New York, Toronto, Austin, the Bay Area, and beyond. Anyone within 1 hour of US time zones is welcome.",
