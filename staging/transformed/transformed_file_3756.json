We've been onboarding some big clients and specifically need a Machine Learning Data Engineer for our client. Position Summary Wayfair\u2019s Customer-Centric Marketing team has built centralized codebases which automate building features for ML models and deploying models into production. Using these and other automation tools, we have made it manageable for each individual data scientist to own and manage dozens of models in production. However, the process of generating training labels has remained an adhoc process without equivalently nice tools. We are looking for a contractor to join the Marketing Data Science team to build a self-service tool for defining how training labels are generated, which will allow users to share patterns and best practices across projects. Technical Skills Commercial experience in working with Dataproc, Bigquery, and Airflow in Google Cloud Platform Strong programming skills in Python and some experience with (a) the PySpark and Bigquery python apis and (b) python machine learning ecosystem Experience with CI/CD environment (such as Jenkins or Buildkite), version control (Git), containerization (Docker), and artifact management such as PyPi Bonus: Experience working with event data in a data lake Familiarity with databuildtool(dbt), kedro, and similar technologies Deliverables and Outcomes A self-service tool that allows data scientists, data engineers, and ML engineers on the Marketing Data Science team to define and version code that generates their training labels while allowing for code reuse between projects and users Cross platform support on Bigquery and DataProc for delivering the final training labels About The Hiring Process Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff. We will answer your questions about the project, and our platform. If we determine it is the right fit for both parties, we'll invite you to join the platform and create a profile to apply directly for this project. C2C Candidates: This role is not available to C2C candidates working with an agency.
