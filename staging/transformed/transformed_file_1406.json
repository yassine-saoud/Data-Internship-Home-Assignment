        "description": "Data Scientist This position is expected to carry out sophisticated operations to analyze, model, and build predictions based on organized disordered data. He or she will work closely with leaders in Data Analytics and Engineering to work with statistical programming, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to help our client understand their members, clients and operations with precision. They should therefore be capable of complex and creative problem solving with the ability to complete difficult projects that fulfill our clients outcomes-based mission. The ability to coalesce multiple, sometimes divergent, data sets to fulfill the visualization and analysis of an outcome (mortality, readmissions e.g.) is required. Creative solutions are encouraged and immersive experiences preferred. - Primary skills for this position include those requisites for developing products that use data to enable analyses, information delivery and interaction with users. Successful candidates should have a good understanding of a statistical programming language consistent with data science and machine learning including Python or R. Our team includes a mix of R or Python. - Knowledge of information architecture (as defined in the field of design as well as the field of data architecture) is preferred to enable the candidate to construct analyses with complex data sets when data engineering resources are unavailable.
