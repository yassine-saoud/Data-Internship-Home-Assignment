        "description": "Who Are We? Hey there, we\u2019re PricePoint! We make buying and selling moving services simple. When companies have employees transfer from one office to another, or move to a new country for work, the company needs to move that person\u2019s stuff...and the process for pricing those moves has been long outdated.\u00a0 That\u2019s why PricePoint was born. At our core, we\u2019re a team of problem solvers who identified a big issue in a big industry, and we\u2019ve set out to fix it.\u00a0 Our mission is to bring transparency and simplicity to the pricing process for moving people\u2019s household goods around the world. We started by building a solution that helped movers automate their pricing and connect to their global partners.\u00a0 After 7 years of onboarding more than 700 movers in over 140 countries onto our system, we expanded to help Relocation Management Companies and Corporations buy those moving services better. Imagine buying something and not knowing how much it costs until weeks later -- that\u2019s sort of how it works in our industry. PricePoint empowers movers and corporations to make better decisions, speed up the process, save money, and make the lives of the people moving better. PricePoint Is Hiring! You knew that. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here! But yes, we\u2019re looking for an incredible engineer and world-class person to join our growing team. We have a ton of new things to build, and over the next year, we\u2019re going to be taking on some serious work: we\u2019ll be updating both of our product lines, as well as upgrading our infrastructure to let it handle 10 times the load. It\u2019s an exciting time to join, and you will be at the center of it all. Some of our challenges will involve solving scalability problems, and improving our automated testing. Whether that means building out a Kubernetes cluster, integrating a load balancer into our deployment process, or improving operational monitoring, we are looking for someone exceptional who is going to roll up their sleeves and make it happen. About You (As a Person): You love technology and you love to build things You want to have a big impact on a growing company You like working in small teams and wearing lots of hats You\u2019re able to work remotely; perhaps you fancy yourself a \u201cdigital nomad\u201d You\u2019re a self-starter...we had to say it, it\u2019s in every job description. But also it\u2019s really true about you. You\u2019re going to work remotely and wear a lot of hats. Self-motivation and the ability to work independently are vital to your success. About You (As an Engineer): You are a great engineer, able to pick up new technologies quickly. You aren't scared of any challenge, you jump in and learn the skills you need to get the job done. You don\u2019t like being pigeonholed; you want to work on the full stack from hardware to css. Experience with web application development is a plus Javascript frameworks (angular, react, redux, backbone, ember, etc) Relational databases (mysql, postgres, mssql, oracle) Testing methodologies (test driven development, behavior driven development, unit testing, functional testing) Continuous integration/delivery (build, test, deploy automation, platform as a service) Why Join PricePoint? We are a growing team with big ambitions that believes in being the best at what you do and enjoying life while you do it. Whether it is designing a truly delightful user experience, getting to 100% test coverage, or picking the best mountain for our winter retreat, we like doing things right the first time. And you will wear all of the hats. Joining a small team will give you the opportunity to learn to do everything, from provisioning a new VM to writing the css that lines up that pesky button. Some of the technologies you will work with everyday include: Amazon Web Services (EC2, ELB, RDS, etc.), Kubernetes, NodeJS, React, Redux, Material UI. We believe that a good engineer is someone that can learn any technology, and technologically, we are always looking forward. You\u2019ll be the person at the heart of all of that as we grow and evolve. Where Are We? All Over The World. Here at PricePoint, our team is completely remote. With team members in four different countries, and our customers spread all around the world, we offer the incredible opportunity to work from wherever you like. That opportunity, though, requires a special type of person. Global collaboration is at the core of what we do, so we\u2019ve built our team with good communicators who can also handle things on their own. If you\u2019re someone like that, you\u2019ll fit in well here. The Fine Print This is a full-time, salaried position. We provide funding for healthcare and unlimited vacation days to our full time employees at PricePoint: if you need time off, just mark it in your google calendar. Don\u2019t schedule time off when we\u2019ve got a big event coming up...but, then again, that\u2019s not the type of person you are. We are still in startup mode, so you\u2019ll probably receive a bottle of Don Julio 1942 Tequila upon joining the company (it\u2019s become a tradition...and don\u2019t say you don\u2019t like tequila until you\u2019ve tried it), but unfortunately a 401k isn\u2019t happening all that soon. In due time. At PricePoint, we\u2019re proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and take seriously the opportunity to employ people of all races, genders, orientations, and backgrounds in accordance with all applicable laws. Ready to Take the Next Steps? We\u2019re looking to grow quickly, so if you think you are a great fit to be a great member of our team, please contact Neal Siebert at neal@pricepointmoves.com, send your resume and a brief cover letter, and let's set up a time to talk.",
