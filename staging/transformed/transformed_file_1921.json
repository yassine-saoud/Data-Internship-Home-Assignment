About Aurora Founded in 2017, Aurora was started by industry luminaries, and now we\u2019re a team with a multitude of perspectives and experiences. Chris Urmson helped lead Carnegie Mellon\u2019s efforts in Darpa\u2019s Grand Challenges, then was a founding member of Google\u2019s self-driving team. Sterling Anderson worked on the tech at MIT before leading Tesla\u2019s Model X and Autopilot programs. Drew Bagnell, also a Carnegie Mellon alum, is a machine learning expert who helped build Uber\u2019s autonomy effort. Regarded as the most experienced leadership team in the industry, these three bring decades of expertise, passion and focus to realizing our mission.",
