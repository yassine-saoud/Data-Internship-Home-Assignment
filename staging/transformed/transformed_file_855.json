Job Description You will help build some of the largest and most innovative research data products in the world.

Your morning starts with data detective work to identify the issue, and you discover an anomaly. You realize there\u2019s a historical inconsistency in some metadata, so you write code in Python or R to parse out that metadata, clean it, and standardize it. Then you update ETLs to Redshift to reflect the new metadata, and you add functionality to the web-frontend tool you built to allow users to search through that metadata in a new way. Responsibilities Collect data from various data sources including survey instrument, APIs, and relational databases, including the tens of thousands of survey questions and billions of answers Perform exploratory data analysis Assess the effectiveness and accuracy of new data sources and data gathering techniques Develop scripts, workflows, and ETL pipelines for data pre-processing, cleaning and model inputs. Deploy statistical models developed by senior data scientists into production environments, with a focus on accuracy, speed, and efficiency. Build and maintain summary dashboards of key survey information for tracking purposes Develop and deploy processes and tools to monitor and analyze pipeline performance and data accuracy Qualifications Demonstrated Knowledge And Experience 2 years of Data Science experience, with an engineering focus Demonstrated experience working cross-functionally with engineering, product, and data science teams Experience with polling, surveys, and public opinion analysis preferred but not required Technical Skills Experience using Python and SQL; R helpful as well Experience using tools such as Pandas to manipulate data and draw insights from data sets rapidly Preferably, experience working as a data engineer/analyst in a cloud-based environment, using AWS (preferred), GCP or Azure Ideally experience building small tools or interfaces for less technical users to interact with data Soft Skills You\u2019re resourceful You deal well with open ended problems (i.e., figuring out the right questions to ask about a data set) rather than being told exactly what to analyze or how to analyze it You consider yourself to be an excellent \u201cdata wrangler\u201d A drive to learn and master new technologies and techniques A collaborative mindset Additional Information This role can be 100% remote.",
