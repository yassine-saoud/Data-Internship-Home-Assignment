        "description": "Axle Informatics is a scientific research and information technology company that offers innovative computer services, informatics, and bioresearch solutions to research centers and healthcare organizations around the globe. With expertise in software engineering, bioinformatics, molecular research, and program management, we focus on developing and applying technological tools and scientific techniques to empower the world of research. We work with some of the top research organizations and facilities in the country including multiple institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are looking for a Data Scientist to support projects at the NIH. The position will be based in North Bethesda, Maryland . We are looking for a skilled and motivated researcher/developer with expertise in image processing, algorithm development, and/or deep learning. The successful applicant will be involved with developing computational analysis of images and other data acquired in collaboration with scientists, biologists, and/or clinicians across the NIH. Computational analyses will involve understanding and implementing data analysis algorithms into a cloud based platform designed to improve scientific analysis of data. It is desired that the applicant\u00a0will construct models using a variety of approaches including statistics, traditional machine learning (i.e. logistic regression, ridge/lasso regression, random forests, support vector machines, etc.), graph analytics, and deep learning. The scientist will participate in data collection/cleaning, data analysis and manuscript preparation; assist intramural staff, including students and postdoctoral fellows; stay current with scientific literature; stay informed about new approaches and technologies, including participation in conferences, workshops, and/or formal classroom instruction; independently locate and utilize scientific resources; and co-author peer reviewed\u00a0publications. Responsibilities: Contribute to scientific-related needs assessment, as well as facilitate the design, building and implementation of IT systems. Collaborate with biologists, clinicians and core facility members to understand their experimental and technical goals and suggest statistical and IT solutions to better achieve these goals. Create generalizable code bases for abstracted analysis outside of a single client\u2019s project such that analysis and technical tools developed for one project can be easily adapted for a different but similar problem. Ability to analyze existing solutions in Python, Matlab, R, or Java and adapt these solutions to a containerized plugin architecture for incorporation into a central tool repository. Strong interest in contributing to biological and clinical research Analyze as-is process, develop to-be process, and identify gaps which must be addressed to reach the desired end state. Assess diverse datasets (focused on images but including other data types outlined above) for correlative, clustering, predictive, etc. outcomes. Qualifications: An undergraduate or masters degree or equivalent in bioengineering, chemical engineering, computer science, statistics, epidemiology, life sciences, or related fields. Be able to program fluently in one of the following: Python, Julia, C++, or Rust. Experience in image analysis (registration, segmentation, and/or tracking) in biomedical imaging modalities preferred, though any image set will be considered. Experience with molecular biology laboratory techniques and informatics methods is preferred though any laboratory experience will be considered. Experience with large data sets (>1 TB) and deep learning will be given priority. A high level of attention to detail A strong work ethic, and the ability to design projects within diverse research areas and datasets. Excellent oral and written communication skills in English, and record keeping skills.
