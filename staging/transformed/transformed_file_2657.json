We boldly pursue big ideas that power transformational advances at Microsoft and for our customers, while helping Microsoft teams work smarter, faster and more securely every day. Microsoft Digital employees have deep technical and business expertise, customer insights, and a clear point of view that comes from first-hand, large-scale experience with Microsoft and industry solutions. We are engineers, technology leaders and experts, digital transformation change agents, and customer advocates. We have exciting opportunities for you to innovate, influence, transform, inspire and grow within our organization and we encourage you to apply to learn more! Security boundaries have changed, and identity is the new perimeter. With such a shift, there is a strong emphasis on carefully analyzing, and in many cases, hitting Refresh on the components that comprise the enterprise identity and access management platforms as we know them. Microsoft is seeking an identity focused service engineer to join the Digital Security & Risk Engineering (DSRE) organization as we undergo the journey to ensure that the right identities get access to the right resources at the right time, protected each step of the way. With your experience in Identity Services such as Azure (including Azure AD), federation, strong authentication, and overall service health, you will help steer our own identity-centric digital transformation and support hundreds of thousands of employees as they seek to empower every person on the planet to accomplish more. Identity Site Reliability Engineering is a hybrid, production-oriented discipline combining deep software engineering and systems skills. As experts in reliability engineering, SREs are typically responsible for improving service availability, latency, scalability, performance, and efficiency; they remove toil from service management, and take ownership for changing production state, monitoring, incident response, and capacity planning. SREs take a holistic approach across client and server: they understand the dependencies both between and within services and drive continuous improvement across them. They care about the user experience and improve business outcomes as the business unit itself defines them. SRE as a discipline improves things via engineering first and foremost, rather than being a primarily reactive function. Preferred work locations: Atlanta, Georgia Austin, Texas Redmond, Washington Reston, Virginia Remote in the U.S. Responsibilities Key Responsibilities: Provide technical engineering for a cross-functional, highly visible, operations team supporting the Identity platform for Microsoft\u2019s corporate network.

Ability to understand, and reason about, interactions between complex systems. Solid understanding of the specific ways in which distributed systems fail, as opposed to code monoliths. Solid understanding of monitoring, alerting, and observability philosophies and best practices. Ability to analyze, decompose, design, and integrate systems or systems architectures. Ability to write tools, automation, and enhancements in arbitrary subcomponents of services/products to deliver and manage software in production (both around services, and within them). Ability to context-switch and effectively balance many competing priorities within many different scopes: quarters, weeks, hours. Ability to advocate for a well-defined customer experience, and bias towards implementing SLOs and measurements to achieve this. Highly adaptable to changing circumstances; able to put the right amount of structure on ambiguous and fluid situations, perhaps with contradictory information. Collaborating first and foremost; ability to exercise cross-team co-operation and influence. Ability to have empathy for any customer or partner and keep a higher-level perspective.
