        "description": "Summary Do you have an uncommon desire to seek out and solve exceedingly difficult challenges rather than the easy ones? Do you believe that a world-class team with relentless drive can surpass even their own high expectations? We do! But we also realize this job isn\u2019t for everyone. What we do isn\u2019t easy but you don\u2019t take the easy path. We are seeking a highly motivated, innovative, and confident individuals to join the CPU Architecture and Performance Team; we are a group that is driving advanced exploration for next generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac CPU architectures. Key Qualifications \u2022 Experience and knowledge of CPU architecture and micro-architecture concepts, expertise in one or multiple CPU focused areas. \u2022 Ability to identify performance bottlenecks in workloads, craft ideas to solve them and implement those ideas in the performance simulator. \u2022 Proficient in C/C++ and a scripting language such as Perl or Python. \u2022 Knowledge and experience with common industry performance benchmarks and workloads. Description The CPU Platform Architecture team is responsible for setting direction for Apple CPUs towards high performance futuristic micro-architecture ideas. We want to push the boundaries of CPU performance to enhance user experience on Apple products through advanced CPU performance features. In this role you will: \u2022 Solve performance problems involving branch prediction, data/code prefetching, cache hierarchy or other CPU areas. \u2022 Build the right tools suited for performance bottleneck analysis so that you can parse through the noise and focus on the real problem. \u2022 Apply state of the art AI/ML techniques to solve CPU performance issues as necessary. \u2022 Conduct continuous research into one or more CPU areas and provide guidance to Apple CPU design team on features that should be implemented in future CPUs. \u2022 Present analysis/findings to CPU architecture and design teams. \u2022 Provide recommendations and influence the roadmap for future Apple CPUs used in iPhone, iPad and Mac systems. Education & Experience PhD in Computer Science or Computer Engineering with focus on Computer Architecture. Role Number: 200264797",
