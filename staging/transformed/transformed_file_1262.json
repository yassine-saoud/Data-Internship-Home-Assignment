You\u2019ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.

Our Organization The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we\u2019re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day. Our Data & Analytics team makes all of that possible, whether it\u2019s getting data from Point A to B securely and efficiently; creating customized visualization tools for evaluating performance or forecasting outcomes; building and maintaining our Big Data pipelines; or scaling our data science models to production. No matter which team you\u2019re part of here, you\u2019ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people. Your Role You\u2019d be placed into our Data & Analytics organization into one of the following roles (experience with one or more of the listed technologies is required): Data Engineer: Hadoop/Big Data Technologies, Spark, Google or AWS Cloud Development Data Solutions, Scala, Python, SQL. In this role, you will build/manage our Big Data pipelines and manage data migrations. Machine Learning Engineer: Data Engineer skillset plus experience with Machine Learning concepts, frameworks and infrastructure. Here, you will scale our data science models into production-level applications. Visualization Engineer: Angular/React, Java, Tableau. Create customized dashboards for reporting or forecasting models. This can be through full-stack web applications, Tableau or a combination of the two. During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests.

Training Soon after joining, you\u2019ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You\u2019ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi. But the learning can\u2019t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you\u2019ll never stop growing your skillset. Communication/Leadership While much of your time will be spent coding or on other highly technical work, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you\u2019re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You\u2019ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you\u2019ll be empowered to suggest new ideas. The Most Important Thing We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude. We\u2019re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate \u2014 not compete \u2014 with others. We\u2019ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we\u2019re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it. This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed. If that sounds like you, we\u2019d love to have you here!
