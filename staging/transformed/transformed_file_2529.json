We're grateful to be on this journey with some of the world's best investors including Story Ventures, Harlem Capital, Co-Founders of Tinder, NBA Player Wayne Ellington, Wellness guru Hannah Bronfman, leaders from Glossier, Google, Amazon, amongst others (learn more here). \ud83c\udf1f We're a remote team with a concentration in New York and San Francisco. While we may be distant, we're all brand-obsessed and looking for the next go-getter to join our family. If you have what it takes to build the next biggest consumer tech company (think world domination while wearing head-to-toe Wellory gear), we'd love to meet you! What We're Looking For \ud83d\udc4b Wellory is seeking an ambitious, passion-driven, self-motivated Software Engineer to join as the first in-house hire on our growing engineer team. You'll collaborate with engineers, designers, and product to deliver value to Wellory's growing user base of clients and nutrition coaches. You must be comfortable in a fast-paced, agile environment (like, really fast) and able to wear both strategy and execution hats. What your responsibilities will be \u2705 Full-stack development with a focus on back-end Write understandable, testable code with a focus on maintainability and scalability Collaborate with a remote development team, review code, test features, and champion bug-free releases Have control over infrastructure, core emphasis on CI and data integrity and general sense of ownership on tech Promote constant refactoring while developing features or touching existing code to keep the codebase as clean as possible Promote iterative development, using best practices such as feature toggles, test automation, and monitoring in order to ensure confidence in our release process Active engagement in technical discussions during architecture meetings, code reviews, and product/design meetings to help promote a culture of learning and continuous improvement Ability to identify trade-offs, challenge ideas, over-communicate and effectively collaborate with teammates Become a domain expert, working closely with our product team and stakeholders Help scale and monitor our services (AWS) Who we're looking for \ud83e\udd84 3-5 years of software development experience Must have experience working with a remote development team Experience with Nodejs, MongoDB, and AWS Experience with at least 2 of the following languages/frameworks: Typescript, React, Angular, Swift, and/or Kotlin Passion for technology, innovation, continued learning, and above all, driving value for our end users Strong understanding of agile, lean and DevOps principles Strong understanding of testing and ability to bring ideas to improve QA standards Comfortable working in high growth, fast-paced environments, and can easily adapt to change Strong understanding of industry best practices and standards Comfortable working with an offshore team, communicating and collaborating across timezones Incredible attention to detail and dedication to quality Bonus : Experience with python, data pipelines, ML technologies or processing data into a form suitable for analysis and reporting Pro tip : you've done your research on Wellory before your first interview! Why you might be excited about us \ud83d\udd7a We're really changing people's lives and helping them live healthier, happier, longer. We're doing important work that helps people create behavior change \u2014 and that excites you daily. You're hungry to make REAL impact every single day \u2014 you're motivated by progress and know that the work you do will move the needle. You're excited to be one of the first ten employees of a startup \u2014 you see the path forward and you're eager to be a part of the journey. You are a team-player who is able to thrive in ambiguity. You love tackling new projects and building the playbook from scratch. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day (micromanagement makes you cringe). Why you might not be excited about us \ud83d\udc40 We're a lean, mean fighting machine (under 10 employees). If you like a more established company setting, this role isn't for you. We're a remote-first company, and therefore fantastic communication skills (verbal and written) is vital. If you don't like to over-communicate, you won't be happy here. We're an early-stage startup. Projects and priorities are likely to shift. If you're not keen on flexibility and a \"learn while we go\" mentality, you may get frustrated easily. Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to push towards our lofty vision. If you prefer a 9-5 job or to rest-and-vest, this job isn't for you. As the very first in-house engineer, you'll be an owner and an operator. If that doesn't excite you, then we're not a good match. We deeply believe teamwork makes the dream work. If you're not willing to lend a hand wherever it's needed (and sometimes that means it may be outside of your job description), you won't fit in.

While we may be remote, we plan monthly fun, zoom-style happy hours, team bonding events, virtual comedy shows +more!
