Our tech-stack and R&D culture As this is a greenfield application, we do not have all the details ironed out, you will help us do that. However, we\u2019ll probably be using some of these: \u25cf Databricks / Apache Spark / Presto / Hive / Athena for data wrangling \u25cf PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras / Scikit-learn for ML/DL \u25cf AWS as a cloud provider \u25cf Python and Jupyter notebooks well, for everything We will be putting a high emphasis on: \u25cf \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honing your skills \u25cf \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Non-blocking automatic MLOps CI/CD pipeline \u25cf \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Letting data scientists research and not distract them with endless unneeded meetings \u25cf \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Involvement and impact on the decision making process and roadmap of a new product \u25cf \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Open-source use and contribution One of the challenges of data scientists is getting data, you\u2019ll have all the data you need, and then some. What do we expect you to bring to the table?

As a seed-stage team member, you will be working on a greenfield application and ML models. You will be an integral part of the design and architecture decision process, working directly with the other team members and leadership (we have a very flat structure). In this role you will have a huge impact on the success of the company. Minimum\u00a0Qualifications - At least 4 years of experience as a Data Scientist / Researcher / ML Engineer - Hands-on experience building ML/DL\u00a0models - Master's degree or equivalent in a STEM field Preferred Qualifications - MLOps and data engineering experience - Familiarity with the DevOps ecosysetm - Experience with NLP, anomaliy detetion - PhD in a STEM field",
