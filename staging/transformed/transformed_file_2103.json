        "description": "Company Description Twitter is what\u2019s happening and what people are talking about right now. For us, life's not about a job, it's about purpose. We feel real change starts with conversation. Here, your voice matters. Come as you are and together we'll do what's right (not what's easy) to serve the public conversation. Job Description Who We Are The Media Infrastructure organization strives to push the boundaries of what media can be included in a tweet, and we own the infrastructure used to run online A/B testing and experimentation. We work with both online and offline systems like Hadoop and with different media serving technologies and content delivery systems! We work across on-prem, and cloud-based clusters. How You\u2019ll Work You\u2019ll embed deeply with your Software Engineering (SWE) counterparts and take an active role as a co-owner of production services to ensure services are built, maintained, and operated in a reliable and scalable way. You will be part of the successful delivery of new features and services, as well as the day-to-day successful operation of existing services. You\u2019ll collaborate with SWE partners to drive operational health improvements, root cause analysis, postmortem discussions, and their associated remediations that serve to improve reliability and sub-linearly scale operations. Partner with both SWE and SRE to demonstrate tools, processes, and techniques to reduce business risk. Perform infrastructure & configuration management, deploys, capacity modeling & planning, and incident mitigation. Identify common patterns in challenges with operating services in production, partner with others to design and implement reusable solutions and/or other cross-functional work that drives down the complexity, difficulty, costs, and risks of operating the business. What You'll Do We are looking for SREs who are passionate about highly performant user-facing services, have a desire to grow themselves and learn new technologies, love working in collaborative teams, and committed to serving their customers. You don\u2019t need to have mastered Hadoop to join this team. Your Responsibilities Include Play a leading role within engineering partner teams for GCP and AWS Infrastructure adoption and standard methodologies. Traditional SRE/Operational support scopes like tooling and automation, monitoring, workflow management, maintaining and improving data pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring, etc. Partner and support existing Media teams with operational guidance and expertise on various project initiatives. Participate in capacity planning and scaling. Ensure media is served in a highly performant way that can also handle viral traffic surges. Support other engineers at Twitter by owning and extending the online experimentation and A/B testing frameworks that inform production rollouts and experiments. Qualifications 4+ years experience handling services in a large scale distributed systems environment. Expert knowledge of Linux operating system internals, filesystems, disk/storage technologies, and storage protocols, and networking stack. Expert knowledge of systems programming (bash and shell tools) and practical, proven knowledge of at least one higher-level language (Python, Go, or Scala). Comfortable working with both on-prem and cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, GCP) in terms of deployment, support, monitoring, administration, and troubleshooting. Experience using containerization software such as Kubernetes, Docker, Mesos. Proven understanding of systems and application design, including the operational trade-offs of various designs. Be comfortable operating as a member of a team, and work well with a myriad of personalities at all levels. Solid understanding of distributed systems design, scaling, durability, and security. Experience with Kubeflow, Scatter-gather systems, Hadoop is a plus, but not a requirement.",
