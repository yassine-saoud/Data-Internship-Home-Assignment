Our team is responsible for the software platform at insitro, which covers everything from providing orchestration and workflow software for our automated lab (LIMS, data review/visualization), data pipelines for ingesting data from pharma and research collaborators, bioinformatic pipelines for our genomic datasets, and APIs and tooling for our data science and machine learning teams. You will work closely with a cross-functional team of scientists, bioengineers, and data scientists to identify areas where software engineering can make a difference. You will design, implement, and deploy software systems across broad domains: full stack web development, backend APIs, data warehousing, data and bioinformatic pipelines, cloud infrastructure, data science and machine learning tooling. You will work as part of a team to rigorously design our software platform, identify key architectural performance improvements and support ongoing discovery and automation platforms. You will be joining a biotech startup that has long-term stability due to significant funding, providing many opportunities for meaningful impact. You will work closely with a very talented team, learn a broad range of skills, and help shape insitro\u2019s culture, strategic direction, and outcomes.
