        "description": "Careers that Change Lives The Diabetes Operating Unit focuses on improving the lives of those within the global diabetes community. As a business, we strive to empower people with diabetes to live life on their terms by delivering innovation that truly matters and providing support in the ways they need it. We\u2019re committed to meeting people with diabetes where they are in their journey, always with an aim to make their lives easier. Our portfolio of innovative solutions are designed to provide customers greater freedom and better health, helping them achieve better glucose control, while spending less time managing their disease. As a member of the Data & Informatics Innovations team, the Data Scientist will engage in statistical and exploratory analysis of datasets such as medical devices data (e.g. insulin pumps and glucose sensors) and smart wearable devices, alongside patient contextual data, and use the insights to build robust classification and prediction models geared toward diabetes management products using advanced artificial intelligence & machine learning algorithms. The Data Scientist will also play a role in advising and assisting strategic decision making by delving into new and existing data sources to define, monitor, and report on key product performance metrics, test and validate hypotheses, help prioritize product pipelines, and influence better product design decisions. This role will partner effectively with product managers, front- and back-end software engineers, and DevOps to identify product features and business opportunities, define need for technology infrastructure, and implement CI/CD pipelines following best practices. A career at Medtronic is like no other. We\u2019re purposeful. We\u2019re committed. And we\u2019re driven by our Mission to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people worldwide.
