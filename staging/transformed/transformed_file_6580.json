        "description": "Site Reliability Engineer Manager The SRE Manager will lead a small team dedicated to proactively building reliability into the Digital Experience platform that is comprised of many complex & integrated systems that leverage multiple programming languages, third-party services, networks and\u00a0SaaS integrations .\u00a0The SRE manager will be tasked with improving the overall observability and support of the applications and infrastructure.\u00a0In addition, the manager will need a breadth of knowledge and an ability to pull different technology disciplines and soft skills together for the common goal \u2013 proactively building resilience into IT infrastructure and applications.\u00a0The manager will build a team with the troubleshooting and scripting skills to improve the monitoring, availability, performance, and security of customer-facing services and ensure they are designed for 24x7 availability.\u00a0Focuses of site reliability engineering include automation, system design , and improvements to\u00a0system resilience. Core responsibilities: 1.) People management Along with the normal administrative work required from a people manager, SRE managers need to know how different disciplines can come together on an SRE team. Oftentimes, SRE teams will act somewhat independently from other engineering teams and need to work with some level of autonomy. However, it\u2019s important that site reliability engineering managers are also well-connected with the broader IT, engineering and business teams \u2013 staying up-to-date on feature development and how it could affect the system\u2019s overall reliability. 2.) Setting SLOs, SLAs, and SLIs Service-level objectives, service-level agreements and service-level indicators are essential to SRE teams. The site reliability engineering manager will define what it means for the system to be \u2018available\u2019 and dictate the availability SLO (internal metrics) of the system. Then, the SRE manager needs to provide an SLA to business teams and the rest of engineering to show how much availability they can promise to customers. Then, the team can start to track SLIs to evaluate whether the system is meeting the required percentage of availability. 3.) Project planning and prioritization Site reliability engineering managers are also in charge of project planning and task prioritization. It\u2019s important that SRE managers sit in on quarterly planning and sprint planning with the greater engineering and IT teams. Then, the site reliability engineering manager can assess the key objectives for the next few sprints and pass those priorities to the rest of the SRE team . This way, the SRE team can begin building features and functions that proactively monitor the health of new features, communicate observations to the rest of the team and add reliability to the overall architecture. 4.) Improving the on-call incident response process The SRE manager will also play a role in scaling and optimizing the overall on-call process .\u00a0Because incident response is such a major part of maintaining uptime and handling reliable services, the SRE manager will be an important part of the cross-functional effort to investigate and remediate issues that impact or could impact service delivery.\u00a0The SRE team will take ownership of setting on-call rotations, alert rules, communication methods and incident response plans . 5.) Opening up communication channels The Site Reliability Engineering manager will have visibility into how teams across engineering and IT are working and can establish communication best practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle.\u00a0The SRE team will track the effectiveness of these practices and iterate when necessary. 6.) Improving service observability In Google\u2019s SRE eBook , they laid out the four golden signals of SRE monitoring . The four golden signals include latency, traffic, error rate and saturation. While these signals are only the start of building a highly observable system, implementing the four golden signals is a great start for any SRE manager. Observability is crucial for enabling site reliability engineers to identify areas for improvement, prioritize future work and learn from the way their system behaves. 7.) Proactively testing the flexibility and resilience of the system Site reliability engineering managers should proactively run tests through their applications and infrastructure.\u00a0This will help uncover faults and limitations that can then be addressed to further enhance system reliability.
