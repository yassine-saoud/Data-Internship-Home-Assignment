Your Mission As a Machine Learning Engineer at SADA, you will work collaboratively with architects and other engineers to recommend, prototype, build, and debug machine learning (ML) infrastructures on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will have an opportunity to work on real-world data problems that need existing solutions using Google ML APIs or by developing custom models. Most engagements will include building and deploying ML solutions using cloud ML pipelines while collaborating with SADA data scientists and data engineers. You should be adept at executing every stage of the ML development lifecycle in a business setting, from initial requirements gathering through final model deployment, including iterative measurement and improvement. You will be working with large volumes of structured and unstructured data from multiple data sources. You can design and implement data pipelines to clean and merge these data for research and modeling. You will be recognized as an established contributor by your team. You will contribute critical components for multiple ML projects. You will work mostly independently with limited oversight. You will also participate in client-facing discussions in the areas of your expertise. Pathway to Success #BeDataDriven: Data is so much more than simply what we experience \u2013 it's how leaders use those experiences to drive innovation.
